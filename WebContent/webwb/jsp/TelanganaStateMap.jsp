   			<h2>Early history</h2> 
   			<h4>Maurya Empire and Satavahana dynasty</h4><p class="paragraphText">The Satavahana dynasty (230 BCE to 220 CE) became the dominant power in this region. It originated from the lands between the Godavari and Krishna rivers and was based at Amaravathi and Dharanikota.After the decline of the Satavahanas, various dynasties, such as the Vakataka, Vishnukundina, Chalukya, Rashtrakuta and Western Chalukya, ruled the area.</p>
   			<h4>Kakatiya Dynasty</h4><p class="paragraphText">Ramagiri Fort ruins at Kalvacherlain Karimnagar district is an ancient fort initially built by the Sathavahanas and modified many times by other dynasties till 16th century</p>
   			<p class="paragraphText">Kota Gullu, temple ruins built in the 12th century by Kakatiyas at Ghanpur, Mulug in warangal district. The Telangana area experienced its golden age during the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty, which ruled most parts of the present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from 1083 to 1323 CE.Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra II were prominent rulers from the Kakatiya dynasty. The dynasty weakened with the attack of Malik Kafur in 1309 and was dissolved after the defeat of Prataparudra by the forces of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1323.</p>
   			<h4>Charminar in Hyderabad</h4><p class="paragraphText">The area came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, followed by the Bahmani Sultanate. Quli Qutb Mulk, a governor of Golkonda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1518. On 21 September 1687, the Golkonda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golkonda fort. In 1712, Qamar-ud-din Khan was appointed by emperor Farrukhsiyar as the viceroy of Deccan with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (meaning "Administrator of the Realm"). He was later recalled to Delhi, with Mubariz Khan appointed as the viceroy. In 1724, Qamar-ud-din Khan defeated Mubariz Khan to reclaim the Deccan suba, establishing it as an autonomous province of the Mughal empire. He took the name Asif Jah, starting what came to be known as the Asif Jahi dynasty.He named the area Hyderabad Deccan. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were called Asif Jahi nizams or nizams of Hyderabad. The Medak and Warangal divisions of Telangana were part of their realm.When Asif Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. In 1769, Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the nizams. The nizam Nasir-ud-dawlah, Asaf Jah IV signed the Subsidiary Alliance with the British in 1799 and lost its control over the state's defence and foreign affairs. Hyderabad State became a princely state among the presidencies and provinces of British India.Telangana was the seat of numerous dynasties. The Chowmahalla Palace was home to the Nizams of Hyderabad.</p>
			<h4>Post-independence</h4><p class="paragraphText">When India became independent from the British Empire in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad did not want to merge with the Indian Union and wanted to remain independent. The Government of India annexed Hyderabad State on 17 September 1948 after a military operation called Operation Polo.It appointed a civil servant, M. K. Vellodi, as first chief minister of Hyderabad State on 26 January 1950. He administered the state with the help of English-educated bureaucrats from the Madras and Bombay states, who were familiar with British systems of administration unlike the bureaucrats of Hyderabad State who used a completely different administrative system. The official language of the state was switched from Urdu to English. In 1952, Dr. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected chief minister of the Hyderabad State in its first democratic election. During this time, there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send the Madras state bureaucrats back and implement a rule by the natives (mulkis) of Hyderabad (Syed alam sharjil) was elected chief minister of hyderabad after (Dr burgula Ramakrishana Rao) for one year he has given rigzine from the post .</p>
			<h4>Telangana Rebellion</h4><p class="paragraphText">The Telangana Rebellion was a peasant revolt supported by the communists. It originated in the Telangana regions of the Hyderabad Statebetween 1946 and 1951, led by the Communist Party of India (CPI).The revolt began in the Nalgonda district against the feudal lords of Reddy and Velama castes. It quickly spread to the Warangal and Bidardistricts. Peasant farmers and labourers revolted against the local feudal landlords (jagirdars and deshmukhs) and later against the Nizam Osman Ali Khan. The violent phase of the movement ended after the Government of India's Operation Polo. Starting in 1951, the CPI shifted to a more moderate strategy of seeking to bring communism to India within the framework of Indian democracy.</p>
			<h4>States Reorganisation Commission</h4><p class="paragraphText">In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) was appointed to form states on a linguistic basis.An agreement was reached between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on 20 February 1956 to merge Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard Telangana's interests.After reorganisation in 1956, the region of Telangana was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh.Following this Gentlemen's agreement, the central government established the unified state of Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956.G.O 553 of 1959 from the united Andhra Pradesh state moved two revenue divisions of Bhadrachalam from East Godavariand Aswaraopeta from West Godavari to Khammam for administrative convenience.</p>
			<h4>Telangana movement</h4><p class="paragraphText">There have been several movements to revoke the merger of Telangana and Andhra, major ones occurring in 1969, 1972 and 2009. The movement for a new state of Telangana gained momentum in the 21st century by an initiative of Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao, the chief of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, on 29 November 2009.On 9 December 2009 the Government of India announced the process of formation of the Telangana state. Violent protests led by people in the Coastal Andhra and Rayalseema regions occurred immediately after the announcement, and the decision was put on hold on 23 December 2009.The movement continued in Hyderabad and other districts of Telangana. There have been hundreds of claimed suicides,strikes, protests and disturbances to public life demanding separate statehood.</p>
			<h4>Formation of Telangana state in 2014</h4><p class="paragraphText">On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously passed a resolution to recommend the formation of a separate Telangana state. After various stages the bill was placed in the Parliament of India in February 2014.In February 2014, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of Telangana state comprising ten districts from north-western Andhra Pradesh.The bill received the assent of the President and published in the Gazette on 1 March 2014.The state of Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014. Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao was elected as the first chief minister of Telangana, following elections in which the Telangana Rashtra Samithi party secured majority.Hyderabad will remain as the joint capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for a period not more than 10 years after that period Hyderabad shall be the capital of the State of Telangana and there shall be a new capital for the State of Andhra Pradesh.Andhra Pradesh picked Amaravati as its capital; moved its secretariat in 2016 and legislature in March 2017 to its new capital.</p>

It covers 112,077 square kilometres (43,273 sq mi).The region is drained by two major rivers, with about 79% of the Godavari River catchment area and about 69% of the Krishna River catchment area, but most of the land is arid.Telangana is also drained by several minor rivers such as the Bhima, the Maner, the Manjira and the Musi.The annual rainfall is between 900 and 1500 mm in northern Telangana and 700 to 900 mm in southern Telangana, from the southwest monsoons. Various soil types abound, including chalkas, red sandy soils, dubbas, deep red loamy soils, and very deep black cotton  [clarification needed] soils that facilitate planting mangoes, oranges and flowers.</p>
			<h3>Climate</h3><p class="paragraphText">Telangana is a semi-arid area and has a predominantly hot and dry climate. Summers start in March, and peak in May with average high temperatures in the 42 °C (108 °F) range. The monsoon arrives in June and lasts until September with about 755 mm (29.7 inches) of precipitation. A dry, mild winter starts in late November and lasts until early February with little humidity and average temperatures in the 22–23 °C (72–73 °F) range.</p>
			<h3>Ecology</h3><p class="paragraphText">The Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests ecoregion covers much of the state, including Hyderabad. The characteristic vegetation is woodlands of Hardwickia binata and Albizia amara. Over 80% of the original forest cover has been cleared for agriculture, timber harvesting, or cattle grazing, but large blocks of forest can be found in Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve and elsewhere.The more humid Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests cover the Eastern Ghats in the eastern part of the state.</p>
			<h3>National Parks and Sanctuaries</h3><p class="paragraphText">Telangana has three National Parks: Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park in Hyderabad district, and Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park and Mrugavani National Park in Ranga Reddy district.</p>
